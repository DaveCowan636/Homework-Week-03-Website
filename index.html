<h1> Where the Sidewalk Ends <h1/>
<h3><p> There is a place where the sidewalk ends<p/>
<p> And before the street begins, <p/>
<p> And there the grass grows soft and white, <p/>
<p> And there the sun burns crimson bright, <p/>
<p> And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<p/>
<p> To cool in the peppermint wind.<p/>
<p> Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black <p/>
<p> And the dark street winds and bends. <p/>
<P> Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow <p/>
<P> Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, <p/>
<P> And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, <P/>
<P> For the children, they mark, and the children, they know <P/>
<P> The place where the sidewalk ends <P/><h3/>
