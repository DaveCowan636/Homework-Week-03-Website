This week was actually fairly easy for me, hard part was getting the file I wanted
  uploaded to the github repositories, Some reason It loaded other documents as well besides
  just my html document (.gitattributes and .gitignore)?
I've had some experience writing html code in python. I was trying to change the color of poems
txt and add a little background color but at this point I couldn't get
it to work the way I wanted.
